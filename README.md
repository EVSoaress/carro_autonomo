Just run the ```map.py``` file.
And choose between the versions of neural networks created between ```aiV1``` and ```aiV2```

ready you can start drawing the sand road for the cart to make its path in the best possible way. All the training of this neural network can be saved by clicking on the save button, it will be saved in the same folder where the file is saved. remembering that the ```aiV2``` neural network has a more rigorous training in relation to the reward, so some movements of the car are limited, so it is common for it to be stopped rotating so as not to lose points.
